# Agentic

Understanding AI collaboration. Not a framework.

The tools already exist: Claude Code, terminal, text, conversation.
Don't build on tools you don't fully understand.

## Core Insight

Unix tools work because the philosophy is embodied, not documented.

## Working Here

- `docs/dialogues/` — patterns observed, lessons earned
- `USE-AS-GLOBAL-CLAUDE.md` — artifact for `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- Templates are practical bootstrapping, not the point

## Principles

```
--minimal          Do one thing.
--read-first       Read before changing.
--no-validation    Skip fluent praise.
--ask-unsure       Ask when uncertain.
```
